                    Last night the mavs lost game 7 to the LA Clippers.
                    <br><br>
                    Super heartbreaking
                    I absolutely hate the Clippers lol. We lost to them last year, and this
                    felt like the perfect revenge story. Weird-ass series, the home team lost the
                    first 6 games (idk how), but Luka proved himself to be an absolute demon
                    at basketball. Series averages were nuts, like (I didn't research) 36-10-9
                    on 50% from the field and 40% from 3PT (I'm omitting FT%, you know why).
                    Anyways I'm pissed, Luka clearly needs help, KP is too passive and Kawhi is
                    a robot who will never miss a shot. Reggie Jackson turned into Ray Allen (?) and
                    for like a 5m stretch Terrance Mann was posessed by Michael Jordan himself.
                    <br><br>
                    But more on Luka, this brother is different. His little back-down one-legged midrange
                    is MONEY. He's developed that out of nowhere at 22 years old.. WHAT. I'm hesistant to
                    say it, but he has seriously potential to go down as a TOP FIVE PLAYER OF ALL TIME.
                    Ok anyways I'm out -- been watching

                    hey
                    <br><br>
                    First blog post, hoping to write these with a more
                    <span onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness', '_target')" class="orange CURSOR">stream-of-consciousness</span> style.
                    Not really looking for conhesive writing structure, that's going to get boring to
                    me (I think). I'll talk mainly about software engineering, basketball, and film 
                    photography. My opinions on stuff that absolutely no one asked for, but I'll do it
                    anyways cause why not lol. Hope you enjoy some of these readings ✌
